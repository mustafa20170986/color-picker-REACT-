            The WWE Universe was left in a state of shock and awe last night at Survivor Series: WarGames 2023 as the legendary Randy Orton made his long-awaited return to the ring. After being sidelined for over 18 months with a serious back injury, "The Viper" made his presence felt in the main event, becoming the fifth and final member of Cody Rhodes' team.

            With the odds stacked against them in the Men's WarGames match, Rhodes, Seth "Freakin" Rollins, Jey Uso, and Sami Zayn needed a game-changer. The arena erupted when Orton's familiar theme music hit, and he stormed down the ramp, ready for action.

            Orton's return has sent a clear message to the rest of the locker room: he's back and more dangerous than ever. The wrestling world is now abuzz with speculation about what's next for the 14-time World Champion. Will he seek revenge on The Bloodline? Will he challenge for a championship?
